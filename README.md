1.`clone repo` copy this link  https://github.com/Nicolaswg/math-magicians.git in to your local machine

2.`npm start` run this command inside the news branch.Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

3.`npm test` Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

4.`npm run build`Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\ It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

5.`npm run eject` **Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.
